# Ravens-Progressive-Matrices-Test
Designed an intelligent agent that takes image files as input and can solve Raven's progressive matrices test. Raven's progressive matrices (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_Progressive_Matrices) is an intelligient test used on young children. My agent uses OpenCV and JavaCV for image processing and computer vision. Some of the knowledge representations used to solve the problem include Semantic Networks, Problem Reduction, and Case-Based Reasoning. It reads in and chooses the correct answer for each problem. After my agent is tested on over 60 problems the results are then outputted in a text file.
